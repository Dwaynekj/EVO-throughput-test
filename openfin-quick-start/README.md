# openfin-quick-start

**Clone and run for a quick way to see message throughput between Openfin Child Windows**

This is a minimal Openfin application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://openfin.co/tutorial-directory/).

A basic Openfin application needs just these files:

- `app.json` - Configuration for launching your openfin app that is used by [openfin-cli](https://github.com/openfin/openfin-cli)
- `index.html` - A web page to render for the parent window.
- `child.html` - A web page for child windows to render.
- `package.json` - Not necessary. Simply used to facilitate quick launch
